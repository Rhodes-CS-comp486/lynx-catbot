Combined Grade: 84

## Planning Document Feedback (Group): 

- Your system description is good. It should be a great starting point for your Rhodes Symposium abstract.
- Your system diagram needs work. Remember that the system diagram is intended to show the high level interactions of your 'major system components'. So, minimally, it should have included a front- end web interface, database, backend 'catbot' service, and a generative AI backend (along with arrows showing their interactions). Your current system diagram seems more like a flow chart than a system diagram. It's also difficult to understand. Let's talk about this in class and see if we can improve on it.
- Major component list is ok, but somewhat unclear. In particular, how you talk about your API connections. An updated system diagram might help improve that clarity.
- Your epics look pretty good, though I think epic 1 may not be needed. What functionality is specific to epic 1? It seems like you can capture it as a non- functional requirement related to ease- of- use.
- Your non- functional requirements are good. They would be even better if you could more precisely define 'reasonably fast' so that it's testable.
- Your techologies list looks very reasonable.
- Your MVP is very reasonable. Even though free form questions would be nice, your appplication would be useable with just fixed- content Q/A.
- Your roadmap is great. Nice and detailed. I have a few questions related to your plans for AI model training, but I'll bring those up as we go.

## Requirements Feedback (Group): 

- A few of your user stories are pretty good (e.g., US3.4), but many have issues. Some are really tasks (e.g., async connection from frontend and create migration for initial database). Others seem like non- functional requirements (e.g., 'Intuitive Display' and 'Accurate responses'). A lot are also formatted badly (e.g., 1.2)
- It's ok to have separate cards for tasks, you just need to trace them back to a specific user story. Ultimately, the user story is all that matters. Tasks don't provide any inherent value.
- You have a mixture of naming conventions for your story titles. Not sure why.
- Most of your stories are traced back to an epic, which is good.
- I don't see any indication on your Kanban board that you discussed the level of effort for these user stories.
- You have acceptance criteria on most of your cards, and they are generally pretty good.
- Your cards don't appear to be prioritized in your backlog. (Highest priority should be on top, lowest priority on bottom. User stories with dependencies come after the user stories for their dependencies.)
